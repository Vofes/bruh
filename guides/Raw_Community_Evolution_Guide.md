Welcome to the cumulative/incremental graph. This page isn't just about who has the most bruhs now; it’s about when they bruhed and how the top bruh-ers changed over time.

\the chart is built like a skyscraper:

The Foundation (Bottom): The very first layer at the bottom of the graph is "Others"—the collective energy of everyone not in the Top X.

From Bottom to Top are arranged on the basis of thier joining date

📊 Understanding the Views
1. Cumulative (The Legacy)
This view shows a "Running Total." The lines will only ever go up. If a layer gets "thicker" over time.

2. Incremental (The Momentum)
This shows the daily or weekly volume. If you see a massive "spike", it was possibly a rush, or maybe someone was just sick.

3. 100% Stacked Share (The Dominance)
This is the most competitive view. It flattens the total volume so the chart is always a perfect rectangle. 
It tells you: "Of all the bruhs sent this week, what % did I own?"
This is useful

If your color occupies 50% of the vertical space, you owned half the server's attention that week, even if the total number of bruhs was small.

💡 Pro Tips for Analysis
Soloing: Click a name in the legend to hide everyone else. This lets you see one person's specific "hill" of growth. 
  Note : Some graphs may not works with Soloing, because it is not an intended feature for this page

Time Grain: Use Weekly to see the big picture (the "Grand Strategy") or Daily to see the chaotic day-to-day battles.

The Others Layer: If the "Others" layer at the bottom is getting thicker, it means the community is becoming more diverse and more people are participating!
