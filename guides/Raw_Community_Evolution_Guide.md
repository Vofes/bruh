Welcome to the historical archives. This page isn't just about who has the most bruhs now; it’s about when they bruhed and how the community changed over time.

\the chart is built like a skyscraper:

The Foundation (Bottom): The very first layer at the bottom of the graph is "Others"—the collective energy of everyone not in the Top X.

From Bottom to Top are arranged on the basis of thier joining date

📊 Understanding the Views
1. Cumulative (The Legacy)
This view shows a "Running Total." The lines will only ever go up. It’s a visual representation of the Total Power each user has built since they joined. If a layer gets "thicker" over time, that person is actively widening their lead.

2. Incremental (The Momentum)
This shows the daily or weekly volume. If you see a massive "spike" in someone's color, they went on a legendary bruh-streak during that period. This is great for identifying "Eras" (e.g., "The Great Bruh War of July").

3. 100% Stacked Share (The Dominance)
This is the most competitive view. It flattens the total volume so the chart is always a perfect rectangle.

It tells you: "Of all the bruhs sent this week, what % did I own?"

If your color occupies 50% of the vertical space, you owned half the server's attention that week, even if the total number of bruhs was small.

💡 Pro Tips for Analysis
Soloing: Click a name in the legend to hide everyone else. This lets you see one person's specific "hill" of growth.

Time Grain: Use Weekly to see the big picture (the "Grand Strategy") or Daily to see the chaotic day-to-day battles.

The Others Layer: If the "Others" layer at the bottom is getting thicker, it means the community is becoming more diverse and more people are participating!
