# 🏆 The Raw Leaderboard Guide

Welcome to the **Archive of Honor**. This guide explains the mechanics behind the Raw Leaderboard and how the "Bruh" counts are calculated.

---

### 🔍 What counts as a "Raw Bruh"?
The Raw Leaderboard is purely based on the **formatting** of the message. To be counted as a **Raw Bruh**, a message must meet these strict criteria:

1.  **The Start:** The message must begin with the word `bruh` (case-insensitive).
2.  **The Space:** There must be exactly one space after the word "bruh".
3.  **The Number:** A sequence of numbers must immediately follow that space.
4.  **Trailing Text:** Anything written *after* the number (e.g., `bruh 5 lol`) is ignored but **does not** disqualify the message.

> **✅ Examples that COUNT:**
> * `bruh 1`
> * `BRUH 420`
> * `bruh 69 nice one`

> **❌ Examples that DO NOT count:**
> * `hey bruh 1` (Doesn't start with bruh)
> * `bruh1` (Missing the space)
> * `bruh momentum` (Missing the number)

### 📊 Understanding the Columns

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Rank** | Your standing based on total valid Raw Bruhs. |
| **User** | The Discord username of the legend. |
| **Raw Bruhs** | The total number of valid `bruh [number]` commands sent. |
| **Density** | The percentage of the *entire server's message history* that consists of this user's Raw Bruhs. |
| **Any 'Bruh' Mention** | A wildcard count of every message that simply contains the word "bruh" anywhere. |

### 📈 Understanding the Analytics Graph
The **Analytics Graph** provides a visual breakdown of who "owns" the bruh culture in the community. 

#### 1. The Density Slider
Because some users have very few counts, showing every single person would make the pie chart unreadable. 
* **Filtering:** Use the slider to set a "Minimum Density." 
* **Logic:** If you set the slider to **0.500%**, only users who contribute more than 0.5% of the total server messages will get their own named slice.

#### 2. Who are the "Others"?
Any user who falls **below** your slider threshold is automatically bundled into the **Others** category.
* As you move the slider to the **right** (higher %), more people move into "Others" and the chart becomes simpler.
* As you move the slider to the **left** (lower %), more individual names appear.

#### 3. Interactivity
* **Hover:** Point your mouse at a slice to see the exact count of Raw Bruhs and the percentage share.
* **Click Legend:** You can click a name in the list next to the chart to temporarily hide them and see how the rest of the pie redistributes.

### ⚖️ The Ethics of the Raw Board
As the name suggests, the **Raw Board** is a "No-Questions-Asked" record.

* **No Self-Correction:** If you messed up the number sequence (e.g., jumping from 10 to 20), the Raw Board still counts it as a command as long as the format was correct.
* **No Spam Filter:** Every validly formatted message is a **+1**. Even if the message disobeys the official "Bruh Rules," no penalties are applied here.
* **The Future:** For a more "fair" and "filtered" experience that removes spam and self-replies, keep an eye on the **Valid Bruh Count** tab.

*“In the end, we are all just bruhs in the wind.”*
