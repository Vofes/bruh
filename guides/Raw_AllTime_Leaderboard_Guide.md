# 🏆 The Raw Leaderboard Guide

### 🔍 What counts as a "Raw Bruh"?
The Raw Leaderboard is purely based on the **formatting** of the message. To be counted toward the **Command Count**, a message must meet these strict criteria:

1.  **The Start:** The message must begin with the word `bruh` (case-insensitive).
2.  **The Space:** There must be exactly one space after the word "bruh".
3.  **The Number:** A sequence of numbers must immediately follow that space.
4.  **Trailing Text:** Anything written *after* the number is ignored but does not disqualify the message.

> **✅ Examples that COUNT:**
> * `bruh 1`
> * `BRUH 420`
> * `bruh 69 this was a legendary moment`

> **❌ Examples that DO NOT count:**
> * `hey bruh 1` (Doesn't start with bruh)
> * `bruh1` (Missing the space)
> * `bruh momentum` (Missing the number)

### ⚖️ The Ethics of the Raw Board
As the name suggests, the **Raw Board** does not filter for quality or spam.

* **No Self-Correction:** If you messed up the number sequence, the Raw Board still counts it as a command as long as the format was correct.
* **No Spam Filter:** Every validly formatted message is a +1 here. (even if it disobeys the bruh rules). Unlike the Valid Bruh Count, no penalties are given
* **The Future:** For a more "fair" and "filtered" experience, keep an eye on the **Valid Bruh Count** tab (Coming Soon).

*“In the end, we are all just bruhs in the wind.”*
